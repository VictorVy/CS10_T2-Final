		Overview:
		Starcraft 2 is a real-time strategy game set in an immersive world of intergalactic science fiction. It has many different game modes, among which include the engaging campaign, with multiple storylines revolving around each of the game's three unique races. The most popular game-mode, multiplayer, features intense one-on-one battles where players exercise their skills of strategy and foresight to come out on top. The co-op mode must not be missed either. This is where players can join their friends in a vast array of different PvE challenges and level up their favourite commanders. There are also many more interesting game-modes available. Come explore the amazing world of Starcraft 2 - it's free!
		
		Gameplay:
		Although thousands of players partake in the wide variety of Starcraft 2 game-modes every day, the heart of the game has to be its 1v1 multiplayer ladder. Players can choose from three races to play with, each with their own traits and characteristics. The primal and animalistic Zerg race can mass-produce inexpensive but fragile units and seek to overwhelm the enemy with an ever-growing swarm. The highly-advanced Protoss race warps in high-cost units that dominate in glorious combat, all the while slowly building up a Golden Armada to decimate the enemy from above. The industrial Terran race trains soldiers to fight on the front line, out-maneuvering the enemy and eliminating them with tactical artillery and air support. The strategies are endless! Utilize your race to the fullest, and climb your way up the ladder with superior war tactics and game knowledge!
		
		Connections:
		I have been playing Starcraft 2 for quite a long time, relative to how long I have been alive for. The game has provided me with countless hours of fun, figuring out the best strategies to climb the multiplayer ladder with. Currently, I am sitting right around the Diamond 3 level as Zerg, where every game presents a challenge. The new multiplayer balance patch has made it very difficult for Zerg to succeed in the ZvT matchup, especially in the late game. Anyways, I also enjoy watching Starcraft 2's professional scene, where the skill level has been increasing steadily over the entirety of the game's existence. I'm looking forward to seeing how the world's arguably best Zerg player, Serral, plays the new ZvT meta, where the Terran will almost certainly always turtle up and mass Thors for the late game. I have plenty of personal connections with this game, and indeed I love it.
