		Overview:
		Starcraft 2 is a real-time strategy game set in an immersive world of intergalactic science fiction. It has many different game modes, among which include multiple engaging campaigns revolving around each of the game's three unique races. The most popular game-mode, multiplayer, features intense one-on-one battles where players exercise their skills of strategy and foresight to come out on top. The co-op mode must not be missed either. This is where players can join their friends in a vast array of different PvE challenges and level up their favourite commanders. There are also many more interesting game-modes available. Come explore the amazing world of Starcraft 2 - it's free!
		
		Gameplay:
		Although thousands of players partake in the wide variety of Starcraft 2 game-modes every day, the heart of the game has to be its 1v1 multiplayer ladder. Players can choose from three races to play with, each with their own traits and characteristics. The primal and animalistic Zerg race can mass-produce inexpensive but fragile units and seek to overwhelm the enemy with an ever-growing swarm.
