		Gameplay:
		Although thousands of players partake in the wide variety of Starcraft 2 game-modes every day, the heart of the game has to be its 1v1 multiplayer ladder. Players can choose from three races to play with, each with their own traits and characteristics. The primal and animalistic Zerg race can mass-produce inexpensive but fragile units and seek to overwhelm the enemy with an ever-growing swarm. The highly-advanced Protoss race warps in high-cost units that dominate in glorious combat, all the while slowly building up a golden armada to decimate the enemy from above. The industrial Terran race trains soldiers to fight on the front line, out-maneuvering the enemy and eliminating them with tactical artillery and air support. The strategies are endless! Utilize your race to the fullest, and climb your way up the ladder with superior war tactics and game knowledge!
